# Project Estimation - CURRENT

# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |                             |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |                            | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                                      |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |                    |               

# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|requirement document    |40 person hours|
| GUI prototype |10 person hours|
|design document |40 person hours|
|code |50 person hours|
| unit tests | 30 person hours|
| api tests | 30 person hours|
| management documents  | 10 person hours|



# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference
