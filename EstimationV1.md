# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |      12                       |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |         100                   | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 1200 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                    120 ph               |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 320â‚¬  | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |         1 week        |               

# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|requirement document    |30 ph|
| GUI prototype |10 ph|
|design document |30 ph|
|code |50 ph|
| unit tests | 20 ph|
| api tests | 20 ph|
| management documents  | 10 ph|



# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
| Identify Stakeholders | 4ph |
| Market analisys on competitors | 4ph |
| Define requirements document | 25ph  |
| Design GUI prototype | 10ph |
| Code implementation | 50ph |
| Define Unit test | 20ph |
| Define API test cases | 20ph |
| Final project review | 15ph |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |120 ph|1 week|
| estimate by product decomposition |170 ph|1 week|
