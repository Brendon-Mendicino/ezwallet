# Project Estimation - CURRENT
Date: 2023-04-19

Version: 1.0


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed                                                       | 12       |
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC                                                            | 100      |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A)                                                        | 1200     |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                    | 120 ph   |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                     | 320â‚¬     |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 1 week   |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference
