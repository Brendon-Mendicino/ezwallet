# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram
\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

```plantuml
@startuml

usecase EzWallet
actor User

User -- EzWallet

@enduml
```

## Interfaces
\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|User|GUI or shell/API|Keyboard, Screen|

# Stories and personas
\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>


# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

\<In the form DO SOMETHING, or VERB NOUN, describe high level capabilities of the system>

\<they match to high level use cases>

| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|FR1|Manage user account|
|FR1.1|Login|
|FR1.2|Logout|
|FR1.3|Authorize|
|FR1.4|Register (name, email, pwd)|
|FR2|Manage categories|
|FR2.1|Add category|
|FR2.2|Show categories|
|FR3|Manage transactions|
|FR3.1|Add transaction|
|FR3.2|Delete transaction|
|FR3.3|Show transactions|
|FR3.4|Show labelled transactions|

## Non Functional Requirements

\<Describe constraints on functional requirements>

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, ..)           | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
|  NFR1     |   |  | |
|  NFR2     | |  | |
|  NFR3     | | | |
| NFRx .. | | | | 


# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>


\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>
### Use case 1, UC1
| Actors Involved        |  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished> |
|  Nominal Scenario     | \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC> |
|  Variants     | \<other normal executions> |
|  Exceptions     | \<exceptions, errors > |

##### Scenario 1.1 

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

| Scenario 1.1 | |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
|  Post condition     | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished> |
| Step#        | Description  |
|  1     |  |  
|  2     |  |
|  ...     |  |

##### Scenario 1.2

##### Scenario 1.x

### Use case 2, UC2
..

### Use case x, UCx
..



# Glossary

\<use UML class diagram to define important terms, or concepts in the domain of the application, and their relationships> 

\<concepts must be used consistently all over the document, ex in use cases, requirements etc>

```plantuml
@startuml


class Account {
	+ usename
	+ email
	+ password
}

class User {
}

note top of User
User who wants to use the app
managing his transaction and categories.
endnote


User - Account : has >





class Transaction {
	+ name
	+ amount
	+ date
}

note bottom of Transaction
Money transaction created by a User.
endnote


class Category {
	+ type
	+ color
}

note bottom of Category
Category that can link together many
transactions.
endnote


Transaction "0..*" - "0..1" Category : labelled >


User --- "0..*" Transaction
User --- "0..*" Category

# System Design
\<describe here system design>

\<must be consistent with Context diagram>

```plantuml
@startuml

class EzWalletSystem

class EzWalletServer

EzWalletSystem o-- EzWalletServer
EzWalletSystem o-- DataBaseServer


@enduml
```

# Deployment Diagram 

\<describe here deployment diagram >

```plantuml
@startuml


artifact EzWalletServer
node ServerMachine

EzWalletServer ..> ServerMachine : deploy


artifact DataBaseServer
node DBMachine

DataBaseServer ..> DBMachine



ServerMachine - DBMachine : internet


node UserMachine

UserMachine - ServerMachine : internet link
