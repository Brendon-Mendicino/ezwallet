# Project Estimation - FUTURE

Date: 2023-04-21

Version: 1.0

# Estimation approach

Consider the EZWallet project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course

# Estimate by size

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| NC = Estimated number of modules to be developed                                                        | 50       |
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC                                                            | 600      |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC \* A)                                                       | 30000    |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                    | 3000ph   |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                     | 90000â‚¬   |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 19 week  |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| estimate by size                   | 3000 ph          | 18 week            |
| estimate by product decomposition  | 3230 ph          | 20 week            |
