# Informal description
EZWallet (read EaSy Wallet) is a software application designed to help individuals and families keep track of their expenses. Users can enter and categorize their expenses, allowing them to quickly see where their money is going. EZWallet is a powerful tool for those looking to take control of their finances and make informed decisions about their spending. 
EzWallet allows people also to attach credit cards to their account in order to automatically track transactions coming from them. EzWallet offers also an easy way to categorize different types of transactions and easily understandable analytics on expenses. Users can also create groups, this could be useful for families that need to track their expenses, or for companies to track employees' transactions made with company credit card.

<!--REMEMBER TO ADD SOMETHING -->
# Business model
Startup company developing an application. Money gain comes from subscribed users that pay a monthly fee to use the service.
<!-- CHECK if it fits -->
The subscription is automatically renewed until the user decides to cancel it. If the payment fails the account is automatically disabled and the user can no longer use the service until the fee is paid.

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram
\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

```plantuml
@startuml

usecase EzWallet
actor User
actor Admin
actor COO
actor "Bank service" as BankService
actor "Payment service" as PaymentService

User -- EzWallet
Admin -- EzWallet
COO -- EzWallet
EzWallet -- BankService
EzWallet -- PaymentService

@enduml
```

## Interfaces
\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

| Actor |  Logical Interface  | Physical Interface |
| ----- | :-----------------: | -----------------: |
| User  | GUI |   Keyboard, Screen |
| Admin | GUI/Shell| Keyboard, Screen|
| COO | GUI | Keyboard, Screen|
| Bank service| API | Internet |
|Payment service|API|Internet|

# Stories and personas
\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>
## Persona1
Persona1: male, middle-age, low income, father, married with children 																					

Persona1, work day: wake up, breakfast, drive children to school, return home for smart working 

Persona1, week end day: wake up, prepare breakfast for family, go out with its family, hang out with friends at night 
### Story
He finds out he is spending too much money than expected, need an easy to use app to keep track of his expenses, in order to be able to maintain his family and keep on having fun with his hobbies.

## Persona2
Persona2: female, young, just graduated, high income, no children, no husband.

### Story
Finds herself with a high income just after graduation, needs a way to manage the great unexpected amount of money she is gaining.

<!-- CHECK: Ã¨ un caso un po' marginale visto che gli anziani e la tecnologia non vanno molto d'accordo :/ -->
## Persona3
Persona3: male, old, retired, low income, children and grandchildren, married

Persona3: day: wake up, breakfast, read newspaper, walk to a bar, head back home 

### Story
He does not spend many money on himself but he likes to help his children and to make presents to his grandchildren on special occasions. Due to his low pension he needs to keep track of his expenses.
His low expertise with technology does not allow him to use services that are too complex.

Persona4: male, young, CEO of a startup company, medium income, no children, not married
### Story
He started his own startup company and he needs an easy way to track expenses made by his employees using che credit card given them by the company for work-related expenses.

<!-- 
Check the use case by making attention to this statement taken from the slides: 
The use case cares only what is the relationship of the actor to the system.
The goal must be of value to the (primary) actor:
-Enter PIN code is not
-Withdraw cash is
(Don't go in implementation details e.g. touch pinpad screen)

# Glossary
<!--Think about adding Chart class, since it's a word used in FR that should be explained -->
\<use UML class diagram to define important terms, or concepts in the domain of the application, and their relationships> 

\<concepts must be used consistently all over the document, ex in use cases, requirements etc>

```plantuml
@startuml


class User {
	+ username
	+ email
	+ password

note top of User
User who wants to use the app
managing his transaction and categories.
endnote

class Admin {

}


class Transaction {
	+ name
	+ amount
	+ date
}

note bottom of Transaction
Money transaction created by a User,
or retrieved from a credit card of the user
endnote


class Category {
	+ type
	+ color
}

note bottom of Category
Category that can refer to many
transactions.
endnote

class CreditCard {
	+ IBAN

	+ owner
}

note right of CreditCard
Credit card inserted by the user to track his transactions,
or to make the monthly payment
endnote

class Group {

note bottom of Group
Group of users that can be used for example 
to track the expenses of a family

<!-- CHIDERE:
  - DB admin negli stakerholder => SI
  - Specializzazione User in Admin, COO (in Glossario) => NO
  - Client nel system design? => NO
  - Table of rights? => nel V2
  - Version Number?
  - Add something about defects found in the project
  - Aggiungere eccezioni dovute al fatto che server/db hanno qualche errore ?
  - Glossario, lo scrivo come penso che debba essere fatto, o come Ã¨ nel codice ? => va bene user separato da trans
  - Add something in informal description about the app (?)

  ---DEFECTS:
  -No admin implementation
  -Transactions and categories are not tied to the users, everyone can see all transactions and categories
  -Get label does not return transaction with attached label
  -Getusers can be done also by users who are not logged in
  -Getuserbyusername works only if done on the user that is the same of the one who is performing the research
